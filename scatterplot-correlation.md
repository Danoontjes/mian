### Used For

* Correlating between:
  * One or more OTUs or taxonomic groups 
  * Alpha diversity
  * Quantitative metadata
  * Gene expression \(if available\)

### Visualization Parameters

#### Taxonomic Level

The taxonomic level to aggregate the OTUs at. 

#### Correlation Variable 1

The quantitative variable to display on the x-axis. If you chose "OTU or Taxonomic Group Abundance", make sure to enter at least one value in the field immediately below.  

#### Correlation Variable 2

The quantitative variable to display on the y-axis. If you chose "OTU or Taxonomic Group Abundance", make sure to enter at least one value in the field immediately below. 

#### Color Variable

Choose a categorical variable to color the points. 

For instance, you might want to correlate the Streptococcus genus against TLR8 expression, but also highlight the disease sample group. 

#### Size Variable

Choose a quantitative variable to resize the points by. This allows you to add a third quantitative variable to explore with. 

### Interactive Elements

* Hover over each point to determine its sample ID and specific variable values.
* Zoom or pan

### Additional Features

* **Save Snapshot**: Save the visualization to the experiment notebook
* **Download**: Downloads the visualization as a PNG file
* **Share**: Creates a shareable link that allows you to share the visualization with others
