### Used For

* Viewing the pair-wise correlations between all OTUs or taxonomic groups and samples

### Visualization Parameters

#### Taxonomic Level

The taxonomic level to aggregate the OTUs at. 

#### Column Variable

The quantitative variable to display on the columns:

* **Taxonomic Group or OTU** 
* **Sample ID** 

#### Row Variable

The quantitative variable to display on the rows:

* **Taxonomic Group or OTU** 
* **Sample ID** 

#### Categorical Variable

Create comparative sample groups based on categorical variables uploaded in the metadata file. 

Optionally create a categorical variable from a quantitative variable by using the Quantile Range feature on the Projects home page. 

The samples are automatically rearranged into the respective sample groups. Each sample group is identified by a colored label.

#### Show Labels

Hiding labels makes the heatmap smaller, useful for large heatmaps.

* **Show All Labels** Show the labels on both the rows and columns
* **Show X-Axis Labels Only** Labels only appear on the columns
* **Show Y-Axis Labels Only** Labels only appear on the rows
* **Hide Labels** No labels will appear

#### Cluster Taxonomic Groups/OTU By

Determines whether the taxonomic group/OTU rows/columns should be clustered by by the OTU count or not. 

#### Color Scheme

Choose the specific color scheme of the heatmap

### Interactive Elements

* Hover over each cell to determine its row and column label and its specific correlation value.

### Additional Features

* **Save Snapshot**: Save the visualization to the experiment notebook
* **Download**: Downloads the visualization as a PNG file
* **Share**: Creates a shareable link that allows you to share the visualization with others
